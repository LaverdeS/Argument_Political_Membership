Further to Senator Andreychuk's question on a third order of government and Senator Austin's dismissal of the question as using political words upon which he did not wish to comment, I should like to ask a question.  
Honourable senators, we had this discussion with the professors from Osgoode Hall. 
We have provincial governments and a federal government under sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution. 
If those are the three levels of government in Canada, what is this?  
If we continue to build aboriginal governments under section 35 as this bill says, we are creating another order of government which is neither provincial, federal nor delegated. 
I am not sure if it is rhetorical. 
I am not even sure whether I would support another aboriginal government if it were being brought in through the front door and not the back door.  
I have spoken to two premiers who were involved in the discussions of 1982 and 1983. 
It is their opinion that if they had know that this would have been the result of those discussions, section 35 would never have happened.  
 The honourable senator said that this agreement is similar to the Charlottetown accord, and to something that the Conservative government had proposed under Brian Mulroney. 
He is correct in that. 
The difference is that Brian Mulroney and the government at that time decided that the people should have something to say about a constitutional amendment, and the people of Canada rejected it.  
It is not for the honourable senator to say, and certainly not for this government to say, that they disagree with what the people said, but that they do not really know what that meant. 
If they want to know what it means, why was this issue not taken to the people? 
The people of B.C. have been asking for a referendum. 
That is what makes us suspicious. 
Let them decide and make it a constitutional amendment. 
Bring it through the front door and not the back door, which is what you are trying to do here.
